## Expected Violations

1. **Heading — WCAG 2.1.1** ❌ Missing
   - Issue: JavaScript widget responds to click but not to keyboard Enter/Space
   - Fix: Restructure to use sequential heading levels: h1 → h2 → h3, etc.

2. **Heading — WCAG 2.1.2** ❌ Missing
   - Issue: Focus can be trapped in a modal or overlay — no way to return focus to the trigger element
   - Fix: Restructure to use sequential heading levels: h1 → h2 → h3, etc.

3. **Heading — WCAG 1.3.2** ❌ Missing
   - Issue: Content order in HTML is different from visual order — screen reader reads in wrong order
   - Fix: Restructure to use sequential heading levels: h1 → h2 → h3, etc.

4. **Form — WCAG 1.1.1, 4.1.2** ❌ Missing
   - Issue: Input id='user' but label for='name' — form control not linked to label
   - Fix: Add <label for='input-id'>Label text</label> or aria-label='Label'.

5. **Color/Contrast — WCAG 2.4.7, 1.4.11** ❌ Missing
   - Issue: Focus indicator is visible only via outline but has outline: none and replaces with background color that fails 3:1 contrast
