## Summary

This page was generated with 4 intentional WCAG 2.2 AAA accessibility violations to serve as a test fixture for evaluating accessibility audit tools and the wcag-skill. Each violation is documented below with its associated WCAG success criterion, a description of the issue, and a proposed fix.

## Detected Violations

1. **Motion — WCAG 2.1.1**
   - Issue: Animated GIF/video plays without user control and without reduced-motion support
   - Fix: Add a pause button and respect prefers-reduced-motion.
2. **Screen Reader — WCAG 1.1.1**
   - Issue: Element has role='img' but contains only decorative text, no aria-label
   - Fix: Remove role='img' or add an accessible name.
3. **Image — WCAG 1.1.1**
   - Issue: Decorative image with empty alt but aria-label also empty — screen readers announce nothing
   - Fix: Add empty alt='' (alt empty string for decorative).
4. **Scrolling — WCAG 2.1.1**
   - Issue: Page contains horizontally scrolling content that cannot be scrolled via keyboard (scroll container with overflow-x but no keyboard scroll buttons)
   - Fix: Ensure all scroll containers can be scrolled via keyboard.

## General Recommendations

- Ensure all text meets minimum contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 7:1 for large text)
- Use semantic HTML elements (h1-h6, main, nav, aside, section) for proper document structure
- Provide text alternatives for all non-text content (images, icons, charts)
- Make all form controls keyboard accessible with visible focus indicators
- Respect user preferences for reduced motion
- Ensure language attributes are set on the HTML element
- Provide skip links for keyboard users to bypass repeated content
- Use ARIA only when native HTML cannot achieve the same result
