**WCAG 2.2 Level:** AAA (target)
**Audit Date:** 2026-10-29

## Summary

This page was generated with 5 intentional WCAG 2.2 AAA accessibility violations to serve as a test fixture for evaluating accessibility audit tools and the wcag-skill. Each violation is documented below with its associated WCAG success criterion, a description of the issue, and a proposed fix.

## Detected Violations

1. **Text — WCAG 1.4.3, 1.4.6**
   - Issue: Body text is 11px with #666 color — contrast ratio 3.8:1, fails 4.5:1
   - Fix: Increase to 16px minimum or use #333 for 14px text.
2. **Keyboard — WCAG 2.4.7, 1.4.11**
   - Issue: Focus indicator is visible only via outline but has outline: none and replaces with background color that fails 3:1 contrast
   - Fix: Ensure visible focus ring has 3:1+ contrast ratio.
3. **Heading — WCAG 1.3.1, 2.4.6**
   - Issue: h2 appears directly after h1 without an h1 first, or heading hierarchy is non-sequential
   - Fix: Restructure headings so each h2 is preceded by an h1 and levels increment by one.
4. **Color/Contrast — WCAG 1.4.3, 1.4.6**
   - Issue: Red text (#e74c3c) on red background (#e74c3c) — ratio 1:1, fails 4.5:1
   - Fix: Use #3498db for text on the #e74c3c background.
5. **Scrolling — WCAG 1.4.12**
   - Issue: Sticky header overlays content when scrolling, partially obscuring the page headings
   - Fix: Make sticky headers collapsible or reduce height.

## General Recommendations

- Ensure all text meets minimum contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 7:1 for large text)
- Use semantic HTML elements (h1-h6, main, nav, aside, section) for proper document structure
- Provide text alternatives for all non-text content (images, icons, charts)
- Make all form controls keyboard accessible with visible focus indicators
- Respect user preferences for reduced motion
- Ensure language attributes are set on the HTML element
- Provide skip links for keyboard users to bypass repeated content
- Use ARIA only when native HTML cannot achieve the same result
